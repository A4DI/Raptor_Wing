# Raptor_Wing

The files contained in this repository are for a derivative work that combines elements of the Raptor Reloaded hand, RIT arm with newly designed components for a mechanism to provide an interface between the RIT arm cuff and a standard Raptor Reloaded hand to allow said hand to be activated by elbow motion.

This design was developed by UWB student and A4DI member Robby Shaffer in combination with A4DI's Ivan Owen.

Apart from the new components, this work is a derivative of the following works, all but the last of which are from the e-NABLE Community (www.enablinthefuture.org):

Due to our currently very high level of activity within the lab, we are unable to provide any documentation/instructions for this design. We also lack the bandwidth to answer any questions. 

These files and photos are being provided so that members of e-NABLE or any other interested parties may freely download, build, experiment with and/or improve upon this design. We make no claims as to the efficacy of this design and individuals who download the files assume all liability associated with their use (please see the LICENSE document). 

Thank you!
